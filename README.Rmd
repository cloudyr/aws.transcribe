# Package Template for the cloudyr project

**aws.transcribe** is a package for the [AWS Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/) API. This is a work-in-progress.

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and to enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. The [**aws.iam** package](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.iam) profiles tools for working with IAM, including creating roles, users, groups, and credentials programmatically; it is not needed to *use* IAM credentials.

A detailed description of how credentials can be specified is provided at: https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.signature/. The easiest way is to simply set environment variables on the command line prior to starting R or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file, which are used to set environment variables in R during startup (see `? Startup`). They can be also set within R:

```R
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1",
           "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" = "mytoken")
```


## Code Examples

To start a transcription, use `start_transcription()` with a "job name" and the URL for the file to be transcribed:

```R
library("aws.transcribe")
t1 <- start_transcription("aws-transcribe-example", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/randhunt-transcribe-demo-us-east-1/out.mp3")
```

Then, wait for the transcription to complete and retrieve it by name using `get_transcription()`:

```{r}
library("aws.transcribe")
t1 <- get_transcription("aws-transcribe-example")
cat(strwrap(t1$Transcriptions[1L], 60), sep = "\n")
```

That's it!

This package is not yet on CRAN. To install the latest development version you can install from the cloudyr drat repository:

```R
# latest stable version
install.packages("aws.transcribe", repos = c(cloudyr = "http://cloudyr.github.io/drat", getOption("repos")))
```

Or, to pull a potentially unstable version directly from GitHub:

```R
if (!require("remotes")) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("cloudyr/aws.transcribe")
```
